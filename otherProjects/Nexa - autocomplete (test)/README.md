### auto_complete: false
___
The Nexa sublime plugin disables sublime's [built in autocomplete](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/auto_complete.html).  
It does that, because sublime's builtin autocomplete does not support all the features required by Nexa.  
If you ever uninstall Nexa, remember to re-enable it.
